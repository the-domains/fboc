![Recording in the SSL G+ 4000 Studios at SAE Institute Madrid](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/58491cdc-2f95-4c53-abf4-e3febe150ed7.jpg)

I'm a self-motivated and committed individual towards my work, and I have the ability to adapt to all kinds of environments.

My passions in life has always been technologies and communication, and since I was a child I have always been very intuitive around computers and found it easy to understand how hardware and software integrates. My inquisitive nature still continues to inspire me every day.

I have a diploma in Audio Engineering at SAE Institute in Madrid and a bachelor degree in Audio Production at SAE Institute in London. Those experiences allowed me to develop my skills in studio recording, mixing, sound editing and Pro-tools.

I believe that in life we're meant to learn, but also that everyone has something to give, that's why we are all students and teachers, regardless of gender, age, beliefs or any other differences.

I'm a very enthusiast person who believes a better world is possible and is always trying to give the best to build good relationships with the people around me.

I'm a singer, songwriter and a guitarist, and I've found that the best way to express myself, to share to this world is through sounds and music.
