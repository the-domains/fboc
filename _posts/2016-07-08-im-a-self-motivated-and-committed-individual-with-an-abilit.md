I'm a self-motivated and committed individual with an ability to adapt to a wide variety of environments.

My passion in life has been technology and communication. Ever since I was a child I have always been very intuitive around computers and found it easy to understand how hardware and software integrate. My inquisitive nature continues to inspire me to learn quickly.

During 2012 I've started my studies in Audio Engineering, developing my skills in Pro-tools, studio recording, mixing and editing sound. Finally in the beginning of 2016 I've finished my education at SAE Institute London with an Audio Production Bachelor Degree.

I believe we are all students and teachers in life, regardless of age, beliefs or any other differences. I'm a very enthusiastic person who wants to see a better world and always tries to build good relationships with the people around me.

I'm a singer songwriter and guitarist as well expressing life through sounds and music.
